# 3D Renderer

This is an improvement from the 3DViewer code, to test and practice my JS skills.
The challenge was to add shading to the 3D models and render them on a canvas with the minimum lines of code possible ( _curentlz it is in the 300 lines range!_ ).

It's based on my graduation project, written in ANSI C, in 1994, which had over 10.000 lines of code.
It was a program that rendered scenes on a regular PC (386 DX 40MHz), to be viewed in 3D using a pair of home made stereoscopic glasses.

The original 3D objects were binary files ( _from the book Programming in 3 Dimensions by Cristopher D. Watkins_ ), that I converted now to JSON files.

Any comments and feedback are welcome!

Thanks for your interest. ;-)
