# 3d_viewer

This is a very simple demo code to test and practice my JS skills.
The challenge was to draw 3D wireframes on a canvas with the minimum lines of code possible.

It's based on my graduation project, written in ANSI C, 1994.
It was a program that rendered scenes on a regular PC (386 DX 40MHz), to be viewed in 3D using a pair of home made stereoscopic glasses.

The original 3D objects were binary files (from the book Programming in 3 Dimensions by Cristopher D. Watkins) that I converted now to JSON files.

Any comments and feedback are welcome!

Thanks for your interest. ;-)
